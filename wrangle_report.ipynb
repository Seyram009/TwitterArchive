Datatype for timestamp was changed from object to date time, rows that did not relate to dogs were dropped and those with null values were dropped too. Ratings with huge numerators and denominators were deleted; specifically numerators with figures higher than 50 and denominators that were other figures aside 10. Anchor tags were deleted in order to extract the source of the ratings. For the tidiness issues, the four dog columns(doggo, pupper, puppo and floofer) were merged into one column which was assisgned the name 'four_columns'. Lastly, all the three datasets (Twitter Archive Clean, Images Clean and Additional Data Clean) were combined using the merge function.It was then saved under the name 'Twitter_Archive_Master'"
